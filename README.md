### Hello I'm Moon!

I'm currently learning how to code in C++ and Java. The langauges I already know are C# and Python. I've been coding for around 2 years now and I got into coding from just seeing how interesting it is and what you could make with coding langauges.

If you need to contact me, add me on Discord Moon#6364
